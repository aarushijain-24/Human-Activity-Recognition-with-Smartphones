# Human Activity Recognition with Smartphones Dataset

## Introduction
This repository contains code for implementing Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers with various kernel
functions and C values for human activity recognition using the Human Activity Recognition with Smartphones dataset.

## Dataset
The Human Activity Recognition with Smartphones dataset is a collection of sensor data from smartphones worn by subjects performing various activities. The dataset includes features derived from accelerometer and gyroscope readings. Each sample in the dataset is labeled with one of six activities: walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and laying.

## Code Description
The provided code demonstrates how to train SVM classifiers using different kernel functions (linear, polynomial, radial basis function, and sigmoid) and C values. It then evaluates the performance of each classifier using accuracy scores.

### Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Results
The code generates a bar plot illustrating the accuracy of SVM classifiers with different kernel functions and C values. This visualization helps in selecting the optimal combination of kernel function and regularization parameter for the task of human activity recognition.
